	I plan to give a brief introduction to my culture and background through nonlinear expressions. Since coming to the States, I realized not many people know my country, Kuwait, or anything about it. Through this story, I would like to educate people on my culture and where I come from to help them better understand me and my background. Our traditions and culture are very special to me and they're very different from western culture which I think people would find interesting to learn about. From the beginning of the story, I would highlight the history of Kuwait's culture and traditions, and how they have evolved over time.
