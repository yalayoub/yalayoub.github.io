	<li><b>1. Where do you get your creative inspiration from?</b></li>
	<p>I believe I get my inspiration from various places, ideas and people. Overall, everything around me has an impact on what I create in one way or another, and definitely my cultural roots always show in my work as well as my passion for incorporating them into my creative perspective.</p>
	<li><b>2. Which creative mediums (such as photography, film, drawing, etc) would you love to explore but haven't? </b></li>
	<p> I've explored much of the creative mediums, mostly photography and drawing, but I also like to try new things for me like film.</p>
	<li><b>What was your favorite class that you took in foundation year and why?</b></li>
	<p>My favorite class from first year was drawing and imaging because I got to explore different mediums and techniques within that field that I hadn't before, developing skills I didn't know I had.</p>
	<li><b>4. When did you first know that you wanted to pursue a career in the design field?</b></li>
	<p>Ever since I was little and can remember, I've had a passion for everything design related. I would notice details and see things in a different way, and developed a liking for aesthetics and art in many of its forms. It has always been a part of me and this is why I decided I had to major in a creative field.</p>
	<li><b>5. What are some important goals that you hope to achieve over the course of your career?</b></li>
	After earning my degree, I hope to work for a couple of years in order to gain the experience necessary to later on create something of my own, even though I'm still not sure of what my creative outcome will specifically be directed towards.
